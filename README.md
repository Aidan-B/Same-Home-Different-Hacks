# Same-Home-Different-Hacks
Entry for same home different hacks online hackathon.

It's a pomodoro technique timer! Focus on your work for 25 minutes, then take a 5 minute break. after 4 work periods, take a longer, 15 minute break.

The app was made with Qt and C++. To use the app yourself you will need to build the source. More info on how to do this can be found on the Qt website: https://www.qt.io/

I made this myself in about 10 hours as my first attempt at learning Qt. Im happy with how much I completed, but I know there is so much more I can still do! I am looking  forward to developing new projects in the future with Qt.
